/*
 * Benchmark 1A — Independent Integer Chain
 * -----------------------------------------
 * Demonstrates ILP exploitation in O3 execution.
 *
 * All additions operate on INDEPENDENT registers.
 * An O3 processor can issue all of them in parallel
 * across its IntALUs in a single cycle.
 *
 * Expected Konata view:
 *   Multiple instructions overlap in the Execute stage.
 *   ROB fills quickly and commits in bursts.
