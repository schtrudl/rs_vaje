/*
 * Benchmark 1B-DEP — Dependent Integer Chain
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Demonstrates how a carried dependency chain limits ILP.
 *
 * Each result feeds directly into the next operation.
 * Even an O3 processor with many ALUs cannot overlap these —
 * it must wait for each result before issuing the next.
 *
 * Expected Konata view:
 *   Instructions queue up in the ROB but cannot be issued.
 *   Long gaps between issue and writeback of dependent instructions.
 *   IPC will be close to 1 (or even below due to front-end width=2).
 *
