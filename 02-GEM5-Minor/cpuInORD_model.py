        Configures the following CPU subsystems:
        Functional Unit Latencies:
            - Operation latencies (opLat): The number of cycles required for each functional unit
              to complete an operation:
                - Integer ALU, Multiplier, Divider
                - Floating-point ALU, Multiplier, Divider
            - Issue latencies (issueLat): The number of cycles that must elapse before another
              instruction can be issued to the same functional unit after an instruction has been issued.
        Functional Unit Timings:
            - Defines MinorFUTiming objects that specify operation latencies and source register
              relative latencies for different operation classes (IntAlu, MemRead/Write, FloatMult, etc.).
            - srcRegsRelativeLats: Relative latency of source registers for each operation class.
            - extraAssumedLat and extraCommitLat: Additional assumed or commit latencies.
            - cantForwardFromFUIndices: Specifies which functional units cannot forward results
              to the current unit, preventing data forwarding from specific sources.
        Pipeline Configuration:
            - executeInputWidth: Instructions sent to execute stage per cycle (1).
            - executeInputBufferSize: Buffer size between issue and execute stages (1).
            - decodeInputBufferSize: Buffer size between decode and issue stages (1).
            - executeIssueLimit: Maximum instructions dispatched per cycle (2).
            - executeMemoryIssueLimit: Maximum memory operations dispatched per cycle (1).
            - decodeToExecuteForwardDelay: Forwarding delay between decode and execute stages (1 cycle).
        CPU Behavior:
            - enableIdling: Disabled (False) - CPU does not idle when no instructions are available.
            - fetch1LineWidth: Instruction fetch width set to 512 bits.
            - branchPred: Tournament branch predictor for branch prediction.
        
        Initialize an in-order CPU configuration with specified resources.

        Args:
            width (int): The fetch/decode/execute width of the CPU pipeline.
            num_fp_regs (int): The number of floating-point registers.
            num_int_regs (int): The number of integer registers.

        This method configures:
        - Functional unit latencies (operation latency) for integer and floating-point ALUs, 
          multipliers, and dividers
        - Issue latencies for each functional unit type
        - Load and store queue entry counts (128 each)
